<h2><center>IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE PHILIPPINES</center></h2>
<p class="example"> <tt>Agriculture in the Philippines is an important part of the economy of the Philippines with crops like rice, coconut and sugar dominating the production of crops and exports. It employs 23% of the Filipino workforce as of 2021, according to the World Bank.[1]

The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable agricultural systems to monsoons and other extreme weather events,[2] which are expected to create more uncertainty as climate change effects the Philippines. <br><br> However, the Food and Agriculture Organization has described the local policy measures as some of the most proactive in risk reduction.[3]</tt></p>.

    <center><h3>✓HISTORY</h3></center>
<p class="example"><tt>This section is an except from Emergence of agriculture in the Philippines.[edit]
The means by which agriculture expanded into the Philippines is argued by many different anthropologists and an exact date of its origin is unknown.[4][5][6][7] However, there are proxy indicators and other pieces of evidence that allow anthropologists to get an idea of when different crops reached the Philippines and how they may have gotten there.<br>[8][9] Rice is an important agricultural crop today in the Philippines and many countries throughout the world import rice and other products from the Philippines.[10]<br><br>

This section is an excerpt from Agriculturist § Philippines.[edit]
In the Philippines, the official professional designation is Licensed and Registered Agriculturist[11] but is more commonly shortened as "Licensed Agriculturist" or more simply as "Agriculturist". <br><br> They are licensed and accredited after successfully passing the Agriculturist Licensure Examination, regulated by the Professional Regulation Commission and the Board of Agriculture.[12] A Licensed Agriculturist can affix the title “L.Agr.” (as name suffix) or "Agr." (as name prefix) to indicate the profession.[13]</tt></p>

<h3><center>PROFISSION</center></h3>


<p class="example"> <tt>
The primary role of agriculturists are to prepare technical plans, specifications, and estimates of agriculture projects such as in the construction and management of farms and agribusiness enterprises.[14] The practice of agriculture also includes the following:
<br><br><br><br>
Consultation, evaluation, investigation, and management of agriculture projects
Research and studies in soil analysis and conservation, crop production, breeding of livestock and poultry, tree planting, and other biotechniques
Conduct training and extension services on soil analysis and conservation, crop production, breeding of livestock and poultry, tree planting
Teaching of agriculture subjects in schools, colleges, and university
Management of organizations related to agriculture, both in private and government (eg. Office of the Provincial Agriculturist)
A prospective professional agriculturist is typically required to have a four-year Bachelor of Science degree in Agriculture, although other degree programs directly-related to agriculture are also allowed to take the licensure examination if they earn at least eighteen (18) units of agriculture credits from a recognized higher education institution.[15] About 5,500 registered agriculturists pass the licensure examination annually.[16] It is one of the hardest licensure examinations in the country with 29.84% passing rate in November 2021.[17][18]
<br><br><br><br>
The agriculturist profession and its board of agriculturists were created in 2002 by the Professional Regulation Commission,[15] in order to "upgrade the agriculture and fisheries profession"[19] by the virtue of the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997. <br><br> The practice of the agriculture profession is a professional service admission. <br><br> Similar to other professions in the Philippines, malpractice and illegal practice of agriculture are grounds for suspension or revocation of certificates of registration and professional licenses.<br>[20] Licensed agriculturists in the Philippines are integrated into one accredited integrated professional organization, which is the Philippine Association of Agriculturists.</tt></p>

Philippine provinces Annual Rice Production 2017
The Philippines is the 8th largest rice producer in the world, accounting for 2.8% of global rice production.[21] The Philippines was also the world's largest rice importer in 2010.[22] In 2010, nearly 15.7 million metric tons of palay (pre-husked rice) were produced.[23] In 2010, palay accounted for 21.86% percent of gross value added in agriculture and 2.37% of GNP.[24] Self-sufficiency in rice reached 88.93% in 2015.[25]
<br><br><br><br>
Rice production in the Philippines has grown significantly since the 1950s. Improved varieties of rice developed during the Green Revolution, including at the International Rice Research Institute based in the Philippines, have improved crop yields. Crop yields have also improved due to increased use of fertilizers. Average productivity increased from 1.23 metric tons per hectare in 1961 to 3.59 metric tons per hectare in 2009.[21]<br><br>

Harvest yields have increased significantly by using foliar fertilizer (Rc 62 -> 27% increase, Rc 80 -> 40% increase, Rc 64 -> 86% increase) based on PhilRice National Averages.[citation needed]

<h3><p class="example"><tt>Corn/maize is the second most important crop in the Philippines. 600,000 farm households are employed in different businesses in the corn value chain. As of 2012, around 2.594 million hectares (6.41×106 acres) of land is under corn cultivation and the total production was 7.408 million metric tons (8.166×106 short tons).[28] The government has been promoting Bt corn for hardiness against insects and higher yields.</tt></h3></p>

has long championed agricultural development throughout his nearly four decades in public service—during his stint as Governor of Ilocos Norte, from 1983 to 1986 and from 1998 to 2007, and as lawmaker, first as the Representative of the Second District of Ilocos Norte from 1992 to 1995 and from 2007 to 2010, and second, as Senator from 2010 to 2016.</tt></p>
<br>
<p class="example"><tt>Under his leadership as Governor, Ilocos Norte saw significant expansion in rice and corn production as well as in livestock. He was branded as “Rice czar” as the province became rice self-sufficient with an average of 296 percent sufficiency level.</tt></p>

<p class="example"><tt>Also, for the whole period of his term, Ilocos Norte sustained more than 100 % self-sufficiency in corn and other major commodities. The province is the number 1 garlic producer and second largest producer of mango in the region.
<br><br>
Among the agriculture-related bills President BBM filed during his term as Senator were Senate Bill (SB) No. 14 or the proposed National Irrigation Program of 2013, SB 112 or the proposed National Seeds Production Act, SB 1863 or the proposed Anti-Rice Wastage Act, and SB 409 or the proposed Philippine Soybean Authority Act.
<br><br>
During the 16th Congress, he was a member of the Committees on Agriculture and Food and Agrarian Reform, as well as the Agricultural and Fisheries modernization and Congressional Oversight Committee on Agrarian Reform.
<br><br>
Now, as the country’s 17th President, President BBM made the unprecedented decision of designating himself as the concurrent head of the Department of Agriculture amidst the looming global food crisis. In his inaugural message on June 30, the President noted that the country’s agriculture sector “cries for urgent attention” after years of neglect and misdirection.
<br><br>
His plan of action for the short-term is to increase the yield of the country’s main staple and provide support to those in need of government assistance. Over the long-term, he is pushing for multi-year planning focused on the restructuring of the food value chain from research to development to retail.
<br><br>
Hence, he called upon the members of the DA family to work fast and efficiently to surmount the numerous challenges that threaten the country’s food supply and stymied the growth of the farm sector for decades.</tt></p>
